Antikörper is meant to be a lightweight data aggregation and visualization tool.

It's basic idea is to aggregate data from your PC. You can then derive
projections from this data, use it any way you find useful.

Possible applications:

- Battery Usage
- Analyze your own PC usage (Which programs are focused when your PC is not
idle?)
- Time spent listening to Music
- Anything you can think of!


Naming
------

The name Antikörper is german for antibody. The idea is that it is there, in the
background, easily forgotten, but nonetheless busy and useful.
